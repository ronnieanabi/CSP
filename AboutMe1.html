      <h4> Hello, my name is Ronnie Anabi, and I'm a student at Damien High School. I am currently in 12th grade and am 17 years old. </h4>
      <span><p>"Keeping up on current events is just as essential as keeping up on fashion" - Virgil Abloh</p></span>
      <p>I believe some qualities that represent me include that I'm a very determined, outgoing, and energetic. I participate in many extra curricular activities such as the United for Change Club, Volleyball, and ASB. My hobbies include reading books, taking long walks on the beach, and reselling clothing. I currently work for my Dad, at Anabi Oil, at the front desk. I have 2 brothers and 1 sister and I'm the oldest child in the family. In the future I plan to study law and hopefully attend UCLA in the fall next year.</p>
